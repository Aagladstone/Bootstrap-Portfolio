                                        Hi there. My name is Aaron Gladstone, I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, and am currently in the Houston Coding Academy. 
                                       I graduated from Baylor University in 2015 with a degree in Film, and Digital Media. I can't wait to learn how to code so I can 
                                       start a new career. 
                                            </p> 
                                   
                                             <p>
                                            I would consider myseslf an extroverted introvert, and the way I describe that is I can be very extroverted, but it wares out
                                       the introvert inside me. That being said it might take me awhile to get out of my shell, yet even when I do, it uses everything I have.
                                       My favorite interests are sports and video games. That being said I am terrible at both, but I love to spectate and discuss the 
                                       happenings.

                                                 I'm very excited to get started and learn this new world of coding. I consider myself a quick learner, but this might take me 
                                                 a bit to get ahold of.
